# LQTAgridPy
LQTAgridPy is a python version of [LQTAgrid](http://lqta.iqm.unicamp.br/portugues/siteLQTA/LQTAgrid.html), a practical application of 4D QSAR analysis methodology developed at Universidade de Campinas. The main difference is that LQTAgridPy has a command line interface and it is written in Python :).

In a study of QSAR main goal is to find quantitative relations between chemical structure, ie, physicochemical, structural and conformational properties and biological response through a mathematical model. These relationships help to understand and explain the mechanism of action of a drug without a molecular level and allow the planning and development of new compounds that exhibit desirable biological properties.
